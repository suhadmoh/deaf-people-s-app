The Monset system is a groundbreaking project that makes communication easier for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Monset's solution revolves around its innovative approach to translating between signed and spoken languages, facilitating communication between individuals with and without hearing impairments. Through intuitive interfaces and seamless integration into everyday communication channels, Monset ensures accessibility and inclusivity for all users. We chose to embark on this project because we were driven by a shared desire to make a meaningful impact in the lives of deaf individuals and contribute to making their daily experiences easier and more inclusive. Recognizing the challenges faced by the deaf community in communication. By focusing our efforts on developing innovative solutions to enhance communication accessibility, we aim to empower deaf individuals, foster greater understanding between different communities, and ultimately contribute to a more equitable society.
